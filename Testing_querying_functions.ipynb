       "'Based on the current guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), here are the key points regarding the discontinuation of antiseizure medications (ASMs) in adult epilepsy patients who have been seizure-free for more than two years:\\n\\n- **Risk of Seizure Recurrence**: There is possibly higher seizure recurrence in patients who undergo ASM withdrawal. However, one Class I study found that the risk of recurrence during the 12 months of the study was not significantly different between groups undergoing withdrawal and those continuing medication[3][5].\\n- **Risk Factors**: Individual patient characteristics and clinical judgment are crucial in deciding whether to withdraw ASMs, as there is no strong evidence to support one option over the other. Risk factors for seizure recurrence include the type of seizures and EEG abnormalities[1][3].\\n- **Quality of Life and Safety**: There is no strong evidence that ASM withdrawal significantly changes the quality of life in seizure-free adults. Additionally, there is limited evidence suggesting an increased risk of status epilepticus or mortality following ASM withdrawal[3][5].\\n- **Guideline Recommendations**: Clinicians should discuss the risks and benefits of ASM withdrawal with patients who have been seizure-free for at least two years. The decision should be based on individual patient characteristics and preferences, as there is no statistically significant evidence to definitively support either option[3][5].\\n\\nThese guidelines are based on the AAN practice advisory, which updates earlier parameters to provide current guidance for managing ASM withdrawal in seizure-free patients[3][5].\\n\\nSources:\\nhttps://www.aan.com/siteassets/home-page/policy-and-guidelines/guidelines/guidelines-and-measures-open-for-public-comment/18guidelineaedwithdrawalfull_pg.pdf\\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/158280/download\\nhttps://www.aan.com/Guidelines/home/GetGuidelineContent/995\\nhttps://www.aan.com/Guidelines/Home/GetGuidelineContent/1103\\nhttps://www.aan.com/Guidelines/home/GetGuidelineContent/996'"
